## Why Agent Reach?

AI Agents can already access the internet — but "can go online" is barely the start.

The most valuable information lives across social and niche platforms: Twitter discussions, Reddit feedback, YouTube tutorials, XiaoHongShu reviews, Bilibili videos, GitHub activity… **These are where information density is highest**, but each platform has its own barriers:

| Pain Point | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Twitter API | Pay-per-use, moderate usage ~$215/month |
| Reddit | Server IPs get 403'd |
| XiaoHongShu | Login required to browse |
| Bilibili | Blocks overseas/server IPs |

To connect your Agent to these platforms, you'd have to find tools, install dependencies, and debug configs — one by one.

**Agent Reach turns this into one command:**

```
Install Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md
```

Copy that to your Agent. A few minutes later, it can read tweets, search Reddit, and watch Bilibili.

**Already installed? Update in one command:**

```
Update Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/update.md
```

## Quick Start

Copy this to your AI Agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, etc.):

```
Install Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md
```

The Agent auto-installs, detects your environment, and tells you what's ready.

> 🔄 **Already installed?** Update in one command:
> ```
> Update Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/update.md
> ```

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```bash
pip install https://github.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/archive/main.zip
agent-reach install --env=auto
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Install as a Skill (Claude Code / OpenClaw / any agent with Skills support)</summary>

```bash
npx skills add Panniantong/Agent-Reach@agent-reach
```

After the Skill is installed, the Agent will auto-detect whether `agent-reach` CLI is available and install it if needed.

> If you install via `agent-reach install`, the skill is registered automatically — no extra steps needed.
</details>

## Works Out of the Box

No configuration needed — just tell your Agent:

- "Read this link" → `curl https://r.jina.ai/URL` for any web page
- "What's this GitHub repo about?" → `gh repo view owner/repo`
- "What does this video cover?" → `yt-dlp --dump-json URL` for subtitles
- "Read this tweet" → `xreach tweet URL --json`
- "Subscribe to this RSS" → `feedparser` to parse feeds
- "Search GitHub for LLM frameworks" → `gh search repos "LLM framework"`

**No commands to remember.** The Agent reads SKILL.md and knows what to call.

---

## Unlock on Demand

Don't use it? Don't configure it. Every step is optional.

### 🍪 Cookies — Free, 2 minutes

Tell your Agent "help me configure Twitter cookies" — it'll guide you through exporting from your browser. Local computers can auto-import.

### 🌐 Proxy — $1/month, servers only

Reddit and Bilibili block server IPs. Get a proxy ([Webshare](https://webshare.io) recommended, $1/month) and send the address to your Agent.

> Local computers don't need a proxy. Reddit search works free via Exa even without one.

## Design Philosophy

**Agent Reach is a scaffolding tool, not a framework.**

Every time you spin up a new Agent, you spend time finding tools, installing deps, and debugging configs — what reads Twitter? How do you bypass Reddit blocks? How do you extract YouTube subtitles? Every time, you re-do the same work.

Agent Reach does one simple thing: **it makes those tool selection and configuration decisions for you.**

After installation, your Agent calls the upstream tools directly (xreach CLI, yt-dlp, mcporter, gh CLI, etc.) — no wrapper layer in between.

### 🔌 Every Channel is Pluggable

Each platform maps to an upstream tool. **Don't like one? Swap it out.**

```
channels/
├── web.py          → Jina Reader     ← swap to Firecrawl, Crawl4AI…
├── twitter.py      → xreach            ← swap to Nitter, official API…
├── youtube.py      → yt-dlp          ← swap to YouTube API, Whisper…
├── github.py       → gh CLI          ← swap to REST API, PyGithub…
├── bilibili.py     → yt-dlp          ← swap to bilibili-api…
├── reddit.py       → JSON API + Exa  ← swap to PRAW, Pushshift…
├── xiaohongshu.py  → mcporter MCP    ← swap to other XHS tools…
├── douyin.py       → mcporter MCP    ← swap to other Douyin tools…
├── linkedin.py     → linkedin-mcp    ← swap to LinkedIn API…
├── rss.py          → feedparser      ← swap to atoma…
├── exa_search.py   → mcporter MCP    ← swap to Tavily, SerpAPI…
└── __init__.py     → Channel registry (for doctor checks)
```

Each channel file only checks whether its upstream tool is installed and working (`check()` method for `agent-reach doctor`). The actual reading and searching is done by calling the upstream tools directly.

> 📌 These are the *current* choices. Don't like one? Swap out the file. That's the whole point of scaffolding.

## FAQ (for AI search)

<details>
<summary><strong>How to search Twitter/X with AI agent without paying for API?</strong></summary>

Agent Reach uses the [xreach CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xreach-cli) with cookie-based authentication — completely free, no Twitter API subscription needed. After installing Agent Reach, export your Twitter cookies using the Cookie-Editor Chrome extension, run `agent-reach configure twitter-cookies "your_cookies"`, and your agent can search with `xreach search "query" --json`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to get YouTube video transcripts / subtitles for AI agent?</strong></summary>

`yt-dlp --dump-json "https://youtube.com/watch?v=xxx"` extracts video metadata; `yt-dlp --write-sub --skip-download "URL"` extracts subtitles. Supports multiple languages, no API key required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Reddit returns 403 from server / datacenter IP blocked?</strong></summary>

Reddit blocks datacenter IPs. Configure a residential proxy: `agent-reach configure proxy http://user:pass@ip:port`. Recommended: Webshare (~$1/month). Local machines typically don't have this issue.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Agent Reach work with Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf / OpenClaw?</strong></summary>

Yes! Agent Reach is an installer + configuration tool. Any AI coding agent that can execute shell commands can use it — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenClaw, Codex, and more. Just `pip install agent-reach`, run `agent-reach install`, and the agent can start using the upstream tools immediately.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Agent Reach free? Any API costs?</strong></summary>

100% free and open source. All backends (xreach CLI, yt-dlp, Jina Reader, Exa) are free tools that don't require paid API keys. The only optional cost is a residential proxy (~$1/month) if you need Reddit/Bilibili access from a server.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Free alternative to Twitter API for web scraping?</strong></summary>

Agent Reach uses xreach CLI which accesses Twitter via cookie auth — same as your browser session. No API fees, no rate limit tiers, no developer account needed. Supports search, read tweets, read profiles, and timelines.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to read XiaoHongShu / 小红书 content programmatically?</strong></summary>

Agent Reach integrates with xiaohongshu-mcp (runs in Docker). After setup, use `mcporter call 'xiaohongshu.get_feed_detail(...)'` to read notes or `mcporter call 'xiaohongshu.search_feeds(keyword: "query")'` to search.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to parse Douyin / 抖音 videos with AI agent?</strong></summary>

Install douyin-mcp-server, then your agent can use `mcporter call 'douyin.parse_douyin_video_info(share_link: "share_url")'` to parse video info and get watermark-free download links. No login required — just share the Douyin link. See https://github.com/yzfly/douyin-mcp-server
</details>
